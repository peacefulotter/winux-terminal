## Fix / Improvements
- Fix scroll movements not being where user would want to
- Improve UI style on some components
- Fix + Improve autocompletion: it should be after the command line and disappear after enter the command line
- (Maybe) improve the replaceContent to replace a specific content not just the last one
- Improve `top` so that it takes the whole space and prevents the user from entering other commands IN THIS SESSION

## Features
- Add support for `explorer 'path'`
- Add support for `nano`, a built-in editor
- Add a help command

## Miscs
- export from browser to app (using electron?)
- change font using google font and an input + change colors using tailwind themes
